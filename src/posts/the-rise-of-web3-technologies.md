# Introduction to React ðŸš€

React is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used for **single-page applications (SPAs)**.

## Key Features

- **Component-Based:** Build reusable UI components.
- **Virtual DOM:** Efficient updates and rendering.
- **Declarative:** Makes UI predictable and easy to debug.

## Example Code

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
import React from "react";

const HelloWorld: React.FC = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World! ðŸŒŽ</h1>;
};

export default HelloWorld;
```
